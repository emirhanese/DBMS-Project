# DBMS-Project
News Portal project with Postgres database.
This project aims to solve the frustration caused by heavily SEOed news sites and save time while reading the news.
The user can hold a history of readed news and can read them again if necessary.
It also groups the news by category thus the user won't see any news that doesn't interest himself/herself.
